# 🛠️ IoT & Embedded Systems Internship Projects

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains **8 IoT and Embedded Systems projects** completed as part of my internship.  
All projects were implemented using **Arduino Uno**, **ESP32 (Arduino framework)**, and **software simulation (Wokwi)** due to hardware constraints, while maintaining **real-world logic and industry-relevant design practices**.

The primary objective of these projects was to gain **hands-on experience with microcontrollers, sensors, and embedded logic**, followed by strengthening the **theoretical foundations** of IoT and embedded systems.
